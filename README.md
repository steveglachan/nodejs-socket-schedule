Integration test between NodeJS, Express, Socket.io and a node-schedule module.

This is just a simple (test) application, showing off chat-like functionality along with scheduled pushing of data from server to client(s).
NodeJS is used for realtime refresh.

Essentially this is a proof of concept type project and a way for me to start learning NodeJS and Socket.io.
